# Smart Parking System
If there's one maneuver that stresses drivers, it's looking for a parking space in the city. This, however, is changing with the implementation of smart solutions.

According to [Libelium](https://www.libelium.com/iot-solutions/smart-parking/), a company that provides technology solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), applying this technology reduces traffic volume by 8%, gas emissions by 40%, kilometers travelled by a car to park by 30% and time spent parking by 43%.

In a crowded place like the image below, image processing is a hard task. The best feasible solution that can be used to have a smart parking system setup is by using sensors.

# Benefits of Smart Parking solution
***INCREASES***
* Optimization of parking spaces in urban and private areas
* Management of special parking spots: zones for emergency vehicles, loading or cab areas, parking spaces for people with disabilities, electric vehicle recharging points
* Parking revenues by up to 35%
* Reputation of being a greener city/facility
* Urban mobility and city planning
* Dynamic pricing strategies based on occupancy

***REDUCES***
* Traffic volume: -8%
* Gas emissions: -40%
* Km. travelled: -30%
* Time spent: -43%
* Parking violations
* Noise pollution
* Fuel consumption
* Driversâ€™ anxiety or fatigue

# Hardware
* Arduino UNO REV3
* UltraSonic Sensors (HC - SR04)

# Approach that failed
We tried processing and image taken from the best angle and these were the results:
